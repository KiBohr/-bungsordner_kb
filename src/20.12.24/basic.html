            TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It adds optional static
            types, classes, and interfaces to JavaScript, enabling developers to write safer and more maintainable code.
            TypeScript is developed and maintained by Microsoft and has gained popularity for its ability to catch errors at
            compile time, leading to more robust and reliable applications. One of the key features of TypeScript is its static
            type system, which allows developers to define types for variables, function parameters, and return values. This helps
            identify type-related errors early in the development process and provides better code documentation and tooling
            support. TypeScript also supports modern JavaScript features such as arrow functions, classes, modules, and
            async/await syntax, making it suitable for both frontend and backend development. It integrates seamlessly with
            popular JavaScript libraries and frameworks like React, Angular, and Node.js, allowing developers to leverage existing
            codebases and ecosystems. Another advantage of TypeScript is its tooling support, including code editors like Visual
            Studio Code, which offers features like intelligent code completion, refactoring tools, and real-time error checking.
            TypeScript's strong ecosystem of community-contributed libraries and typings further enhances its usability and
            productivity. Overall, TypeScript provides a powerful and flexible language for building scalable and maintainable web
            applications, offering the benefits of static typing without sacrificing the flexibility and expressiveness of
            JavaScript.
